As a student, I'm always looking for something new to practice and I really love free courses that are available all over the Web. So I decided to take this one about "themes toggling" to practice CSS and JS and afterward try to build a new project more complex and useful having this one as a base (this is a project for another day).

This project is a fundamental web application developed during a course at [**Bradesco Foundation (Fundação Bradesco)**](https://www.ev.org.br/). It represents my early steps in learning how to manipulate the DOM and manage styles dynamically.

## 🦈 Evolution

This "small fish" project was the core inspiration for my larger and more complex projects, like **StyleMix**, where I took these theme concepts to a professional level!
