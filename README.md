# 🐠 Simple Theme Switcher

As a student, I'm always looking for something new to practice and I really love free courses that are available all over the Web. So I decided to take this one about "themes toggling" to practice CSS and JS and afterward try to build a new project more complex and useful having this one as a base (this is a project for another day).

This project is a fundamental web application developed during a course at [**Bradesco Foundation (Fundação Bradesco)**](https://www.ev.org.br/). It represents my early steps in learning how to manipulate the DOM and manage styles dynamically.

This "small fish" project was the core inspiration for my larger and more complex projects, like **StyleMix**, where I took these theme concepts to a professional level!
